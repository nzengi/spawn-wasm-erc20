# Spawn - WASM ERC-20 Token Library

Spawn is a project that aims to create an ERC-20 standard-compliant token library optimized to run in WebAssembly (WASM) environments. The project focuses on performance and security, providing developers with a customizable, high-performance library that can be easily integrated into blockchain applications.

## Project Goal

The **Spawn WASM ERC-20 token library** offers Web3 developers a lightweight, fast, and secure solution for implementing tokens in their projects. This library enhances the efficiency of ERC-20 token contracts while making them usable in browser environments and other platforms compatible with WebAssembly (WASM).

## Key Features

- **ERC-20 Compliant:** Fully implements the ERC-20 token standard functions, including `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `approve`, and `transferFrom`.
- **WebAssembly Support:** Designed to run in WASM environments, allowing for high performance in browser-based decentralized applications (dApps) and other Web3 platforms.
- **High Performance:** Optimized for speed and efficiency, reducing gas costs and improving execution times.
- **Secure and Reliable:** Focused on ensuring a high level of security, preventing common vulnerabilities in token contracts.
- **Customizable:** Easily extendable for developers who want to add custom functionality to their token contracts.
